📩 Contact Form with Validation
📌 Summary

This project is a simple and responsive Contact Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It validates user inputs on the client side to ensure proper data entry before submission. The form checks for empty fields, validates email format with regex, and shows error messages below the inputs if validation fails. On successful validation, a success message is displayed (no backend integration). The form is styled with CSS for clarity and made responsive for desktop and mobile devices.
